As mentioned previously, a major set of goals for the project is to blur the line between user and developer, client and server, as well as documentation and source code. To achieve this, a number of philosophies about how the project is run will be practiced.

Where possible, we favour the contributor over the process. As much as we can, we will seek to remove barriers to having people contribute, and try to get people involved vs. maintaining some aspirational but impractical level of quality. If we break something, we'll fix it as we go. Don't let that stop people from trying.

Another way to do this is through automation. Things like using prettier, simplifying our source tree, using Markdown whenever possible and building web content, automatic deployment, etc.

We will use Issues for more than just technical discussions. Users can ask questions, and we'll migrate answers to Markdown ```/docs``` files whenever we can. We'll also encourage developers and users to contribute to the project's ```/blog``` and tell us what they're doing, how they're using the project, what they've built, ideas they have, cool things they're learning, etc.

We'll attempt to give-back to the communities building tech we use. Our developers will work on PRs and provide help to the projects that are helping us.
