# Bramble is based on Brackets

Brackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS
and JavaScript that is  *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Brackets is at 1.0 and we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our
[trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsTrelloBoard) that we're anxious to add and other
innovative web development workflows that we're planning to build into Brackets.
So take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor.

You can see some
[screenshots of Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots)
on the wiki, [intro videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets) on YouTube, and news on the [Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/).

The text editor inside Brackets is based on
[CodeMirror](http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror)&mdash;thanks to Marijn for
taking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See
[Notes on CodeMirror](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Notes-on-CodeMirror)
for info on how we're using CodeMirror.

# How to setup Bramble (Brackets) in your local machine

Step 1: Make sure you fork and clone [Brackets](https://github.com/mozilla/brackets).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/brackets --recursive
```

Step 2: Install its dependencies

Navigate to the root of the directory you cloned and run:

```
$ npm install
```

NOTE: if you are running on Windows, and experience a build error with the `iltorb` package,
consider adding the `--no-optional` flag to have npm skip installing `iltorb`, which is optional
and requires python, gyp and a working c++ build environment.
See comment in https://github.com/mozilla/brackets/pull/588#issuecomment-280438175

Step 3: Run Bramble:

The easiest way to run Bramble is to simply use:

```
$ npm start
```

This will generate the strings needed for localization in your `src/nls` folder and allow you to access Bramble on `localhost:8000` (NOTE: you need npm version 5 for the cleanup step to run properly; if it doesn't, use `npm run unlocalize` to restore the files in `src/nls/**/*`). It will also build the Bramble iframe API in `dist/` if necessary. You can terminate the server with `Ctrl+C` which will also clean up the strings that were generated in your `src/nls` folder. If any changes are made in the `src` directory, just refresh the page hosting Bramble in your browser to reflect those changes.

If you want to simply run the server without the localized strings, run:

```
$ npm run server
```

However, if you wish to run your own static server, there are several options available:
* [Apache Webserver](http://www.apache.org/)
* Host on [github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages)
* [Python WebServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)

Assuming you have Bramble running on port `8000`. Now you can visit [http://localhost:8000/src](http://localhost:8000/src).

**NOTE 1:** Bramble expects to be run in an iframe, which hosts its filesystem. For local
development, use `src/hosted.html` instead of `src/index.html`.  To see how the remote end
should host Bramble's iframe, see `src/hosted.js`.

**NOTE 2:** Using `npm run build` will overwrite contents in the `src/nls` folder. These changes are necessary if you access Bramble using [http://localhost:8000/src](http://localhost:8000/src). After using Bramble, you can undo the changes by running `npm run unlocalize`.

**NOTE 3:** To use Bramble in a production setting locally, you can run `npm run production` and access Bramble at [http://localhost:8000/dist](http://localhost:8000/dist)

# Extension Loading

Bramble loads a set of extensions defined in `src/extensions/bramble-extensions.json`. You can
alter which extensions Bramble loads by adding or removing items from this list.  You can also
temporarily disable extensions by using `?disableExtensions`. For example: to disable QuickView
and CSSCodeHints, load Bramble with `?disableExtensions=QuickView,CSSCodeHints` on the URL.

--------------

## After installation

After you have everything setup, you can now run the server you chose in the root of your local Bramble directory and see it in action by visiting [http://localhost:8000/src](http://localhost:8000/src).

# Bramble IFrame API

Bramble is designed to be run in an iframe, and the hosting web app to communicate with it
via `postMessage` and `MessageChannel`.  In order to simplify this, a convenience API exists
for creating and managing the iframe, as well as providing JavaScript functions for interacting
with the editor, preview, etc.

## Loading the API

The hosting app must include the Bramble IFrame API (i.e., `dist/bramble.js`).  Note: in
development you can use `src/hosted.html`, which does this.  This script can either be used as
an AMD module, or as a browser global:

```html
<script src="bramble.js"></script>
<script>
  // Option 1: AMD loading, assumes requirejs is loaded already
  require(["bramble"], function(Bramble) {
    ...
  });

  // Option 2: Browser global
  var Bramble = window.Bramble;
</script>
```

## Bramble

The Bramble module has a number of methods, properties, and events. During its lifetime,
Bramble goes through a number of states, including:

* `Bramble.ERROR` - Bramble is in an error state
* `Bramble.NOT_LOADED` - Initial state, `Bramble.load()` has not been called
* `Bramble.LOADING` - `Bramble.load()` has been called, loading resources has begun
* `Bramble.MOUNTABLE` - Loading is done and `Bramble.mount()` can be begin, or is safe to start
* `Bramble.MOUNTING` - `Bramble.mount()` is being called, mounting is in process
* `Bramble.READY` - `Bramble.mount()` has finished, Bramble is fully ready

The current state of Bramble can be obtained by calling `Bramble.getReadyState()`.  There are
also a number of events you can listen for (i.e., `Bramble` is an [`EventEmitter`](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter/)):

```js
Bramble.once("ready", function(bramble) {
  // bramble is the Bramble proxy instance, see below.
});

Bramble.on("error", function(err) {
  // Bramble is in an error state, and `err` is the error.
})

Bramble.on("readyStateChange", function(previous, current) {
  // Bramble's readyState changed from `previous` to `current`
});
```

NOTE: in some browsers (e.g., Firefox) when the user is in "Private Browsing"
mode, the filesystem (i.e., IndexedDB) will be inaccessible, and an error
will be sent via the `error` event (i.e., `err.code === "EFILESYSTEMERROR"`).  This
is the same error that occurs when the filesystem is corrupt (see `autoRecoverFileSystem` below).

## Bramble Offline Support

The Bramble code is offline capable, and will indicate, via events, when it is ready to be used offline, as well as
when there are updates available for existing offline cached resources. These events are triggered on `Bramble` vs.
the `bramble` instance.  The offline related events include:

* `"offlineReady"` - triggered when Bramble has been fully cached for offline use.  Users can safely work without network.
* `"updatesAvailable"` - triggered when new or updated Bramble resources have been cached and are available for use. You might use this to indicate to the user that they should refresh the page to begin using the updates.

## Bramble.getFileSystem()

The FileSystem is owned by the hosting application, and can be obtained at any time by calling:

```js
var fs = Bramble.getFileSystem();
```

This `fs` instance can be used to setup the filesystem for the Bramble editor prior to
loading.  You can access things like `Path` and `Buffer` via `Bramble.Filer.*`.

## Bramble.formatFileSystem(callback)

WARNING: this **will** destroy data, and is meant to be used in the case that
the filesystem is corrupted (`err.code === "EFILESYSTEMERROR"`), or for when an
app wants to allow a user to wipe their disk.

```js
Bramble.on("error", function(err) {
  if(err.code === "EFILESYSTEMERROR") {
    Bramble.formatFileSystem(function(err) {
      if(err) {
        // Unable to create filesystem, fatal (and highly unlikely) error
      } else {
        // filesystem is now clean and empty, use Bramble.getFileSystem() to obtain instance
      }
    });
  }
});
```

NOTE: you can turn this recovery behaviour on automatically by passing `autoRecoverFileSystem: true`
in the options to `Bramble.load()`.

## Bramble.load(elem[, options])

Once you have a reference to the `Bramble` object, you use it to starting loading the editor:

```js
// Start loading Bramble
Bramble.load("#webmaker-bramble");

Bramble.once("error", function(err) {
  console.error("Bramble error", err);
});
```

The `elem` argument specifies which element in the DOM should be used to hold the iframe.
This element's contents will be replaced by the iframe.  You can pass a selector, a reference
to an actual DOM element, or leave it blank, and `document.body` will be used.

The `options` object allows you to configure Bramble:

 * `url`: `<String>` a URL to use when loading the Bramble iframe (defaults to prod)
 * `locale`: `<String>` the locale Brackets should use
 * `useLocationSearch`: `<Boolean>` whether to copy the window's location.search string to the iframe's url
 * `extensions:` `<Object>` with the following optional properties
     * `enable`: `<Array(String)>` a list of extensions to enable
     * `disable`: `<Array(String)>` a list of extensions to disable
 * `hideUntilReady`: `<Boolean>` whether to hide Bramble until it's fully loaded.
 * `disableUIState`: `<Boolean>` by default, UI state is kept between sessions.  This disables it (and clears old values), and uses the defaults from Bramble.
 * `autoRecoverFileSystem`: `<Boolean>` whether to try and autorecover the filesystem on failure (see `Bramble.formatFileSystem` above).
 * `debug`: `<Boolean>` whether to log debug info.
 * `zipFilenamePrefix`: `<String>` the prefix name to use for project zip files, or `"thimble-project"` by default.
 * `capacity`: `<Number>` the number of bytes of disk space to allow for this project.  Defaults to 5MB if not set.

## Bramble.mount(root[, filename])

After calling `Bramble.load()`, you can tell Bramble which project root directory
to open, and which file to load into the editor.  NOTE: the optional `filename` argument,
if provided, should be a relative path within the project root.  Bramble will use this information
when it is ready to mount the filesystem.  Use the `"ready"` event to get access to the
`bramble` instance:

```js
// Setup the filesystem while Bramble is loading
var fs = Bramble.getFileSystem();

Bramble.once("ready", function(bramble) {
  // The bramble instance is now usable, see below.
});

fs.mkdir("/project", function(err) {
  // If we run this multiple times, the dir will already exist
  if (err && err.code !== "EEXIST") {
    throw err;
  }

  var html = ""                    +
    "<html>\n"                     +
    "  <head>\n"                   +
    "    <title>Bramble</title>\n" +
    "  </head>\n"                  +
    "  <body>\n"                   +
    "    <p>Hello World</p>\n"     +
    "  </body>\n"                  +
    "</html>";

  fs.writeFile("/project/index.html", html, function(err) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    // Now that fs is setup, tell Bramble which root dir to mount
    // and which file within that root to open on startup.
    Bramble.mount("/project", "index.html");
  });
});
```

## Bramble Instance Getters

Once the Bramble instance is created (e.g., via `ready` event or `Bramble.mount()` callback),
a number of read-only getters are available in order to access state information in the Bramble editor:

* `getID()` - returns the iframe element's `id` in the DOM
* `getIFrame()` - returns a reference to the iframe that hosts Bramble
* `getFullPath()` - returns the absolute path of the file currently being edited
* `getFilename()` - returns the filename portion (i.e., no dir info) of the file currently being edited
* `getPreviewMode()` - returns one of `"mobile"` or `"desktop"`, depending on current preview mode
* `getSidebarVisible()` - returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the sidebar (file tree) is visible
* `getLayout()` - returns an `Object` with three integer properties: `sidebarWidth`, `firstPaneWidth`, `secondPaneWidth`.  The `firstPaneWidth` refers to the editor, where `secondPaneWidth` is the preview.
* `getRootDir()` - returns the project root directory to which Bramble is mounted
* `getTheme()` - returns the name of the current theme.
* `getFontSize()` - returns the current font size as a string (e.g., `"12px"`).
* `getWordWrap()` - returns the current word wrap setting as a `Boolean` (i.e., enabled or disabled).
* `getAllowJavaScript()` - returns the current allow javascript setting as a `Boolean` (i.e., enabled or disabled).
* `getAutocomplete()` - returns the current autocomplete settings as a `Boolean` (i.e., enabled or disabled).
* `getAutoCloseTags()` - returns the current close tags setting as an `Object` with three properties: `whenOpening` a boolean that determines whether opening tags are closed upon typing ">", `whenClosing` a boolean that determines whether closing tags are closed upon typing "/", and an array of tags `indentTags`, that when opened, has a blank line. These values default to, respectively: `true`, `true`, and an empty array.
* `getTutorialExists()` - returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not there is a tutorial in the project (i.e., if `tutorial.html` is present)
* `getTutorialVisible()` - returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not the preview browser is showing a tutorial or not.
* `getAutoUpdate()` - returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not the auto update preference is enabled or not.
* `getTotalProjectSize()` - returns the current project size in bytes.
* `hasIndexFile()` - returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not there is an `"index.html"` file.
* `getFileCount()` - returns total file count.

**NOTE**: calling these getters before the `ready()` callback on the bramble instance
won't do what you want.

## Bramble Instance Methods

The Bramble instance has a number of methods you can call in order to interact with the
Bramble editor and preview, all of which take an optional `callback` argument if you want
to be notified when the action completes:

* `openSVGasImage([callback])` - treats `.svg` files as Images and shows them in image viewer.

## Bramble Instance Events

The Bramble instance is also an [`EventEmitter`](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter/) and raises
the following events:

* `"layout"` - triggered whenever the sidebar, editor, or preview panes are changed. It includes an `Object` that returns the same information as the `getLayout()` getter: `sidebarWidth`, `firstPaneWidth`, `secondPathWidth`
* `"activeEditorChange"` - triggered whenever the editor changes from one file to another. It includes an `Object` with the current file's `fullPath` and `filename`.
* `"previewModeChange"` - triggered whenever the preview mode is changed. It includes an `Object` with the new `mode`
* `"sidebarChange"` - triggered whenever the sidebar is hidden or shown. It includes an `Object` with a `visible` property set to `true` or `false`
* `"themeChange"` - triggered whenever the theme changes. It includes an `Object` with a `theme` property that indicates the new theme
* `"fontSizeChange"` - triggered whenever the font size changes. It includes an `Object` with a `fontSize` property that indicates the new size (e.g., `"12px"`).
* `"wordWrapChange"` - triggered whenever the word wrap value changes. It includes an `Object` with a `wordWrap` property that indicates the new value (e.g., `true` or `false`).
* `"allowJavaScriptChange"` - triggered whenever the allow javascript value changes. It includes an `Object` with a `allowJavaScript` property that indicates the new value (e.g., `true` or `false`).
* `"autoCloseTagsChange"` - triggered whenever the close tag value changes. It includes an `Object` with a `autoCloseTags` property that indicates the new value
* `"tutorialAdded"` - triggered when a new tutorial is added to the project
* `"tutorialRemoved"` - triggered when an existing tutorial for the project is removed
* `"tutorialVisibilityChange"` - triggered when the tutorial preview is turned on or off. It includes an `Object` with a `visibility` property that indicates whether the tutorial is visible.
* `"inspectorChange"` - triggered whenever the inspector changes from enabled to disabled, or vice versa. It includes an `Object` with an `enabled` property set to `true` or `false`.
* `"autoUpdateChange"` - triggered whenever the auto update preference changes from enabled to disabled, or vice versa. It includes an `Object` with a `autoUpdate` property set to `true` or `false`
* `"projectDirty"` - triggered when one of the files in the project has been edited and those changes haven't been saved yet. It includes an `Object` with the `path` to the current file.
* `"projectSaved"` - triggered whenever the changes are saved to the filesystem in the browser are completed.
* `"dialogOpened"` - triggered whenever a modal dialog opens, like when a user is deleting a file.
* `"dialogClosed"` - triggered whenever a modal dialog closes.
* `"capacityExceeded"` - triggered whenever the project's files reach or exceed the maximum allowed disk capacity. Some operations will be disallowed until sufficient space has been recovered (e.g., user deletes files). A second argument, `size`, indicates the number of bytes the project is over capacity.
* `"capacityRestored"` - triggered after a `"capacityExceeded"` event when sufficient space has been recovered to continue normal disk activity.
* `"projectSizeChange"` - triggered when the project's size on disk changes. The event includes two arguments: `size`, which is the new size of the project in bytes, and `percentUsed` which is a percentage of disk space used out of the total available capacity.

There are also high-level events for changes to files:

* `"fileChange"` - triggered whenever a file is created or updated within the project root.  It includes the `filename` of the file that changed.
* `"fileDelete"` - triggered whenever a file is deleted within the project root.  It includes the `filename` of the file that was deleted.
* `"fileRename"` - triggered whenever a file is renamed within the project root.  It includes the `oldFilename` and the `newFilename` of the file that was renamed.
* `"folderRename"` - triggered whenever a folder is renamed within the project root. It includes an object that looks something like this:
```js
{
  oldPath: "/path/before/rename",
  newPath: "/path/after/rename",
  // Paths to all files contained inside the folder being renamed
  children: [ "relativeFilePath1",  "relativeFilePath2", ... ]
}
```

NOTE: if you want to receive generic events for file system events, especially events across windows using the same file system, use [fs.watch()](https://github.com/filerjs/filer#watch) instead.

# Troubleshooting

If you forgot to add the `--recursive` flag while cloning this repository, you might run into a similar error:

```bash
Tracing dependencies for: main
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '[..]/brackets/src/thirdparty/text/text.js'
In module tree:
    brackets
      language/LanguageManager
        file/FileUtils
          utils/Global
```

To fix it, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the main directory.
